# Keystore Configuration

## Production Keystore Setup

For production builds, you need to create a release keystore and configure the signing credentials.

### Creating a Release Keystore

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -alias expense_tracker_key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables or add them to your `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=keystore/release.keystore
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=your_store_password
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=expense_tracker_key
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

### Security Notes

- Never commit the actual keystore file to version control
- Use strong passwords for both store and key
- Keep backup copies of your keystore in secure locations
- The keystore is required for all future app updates

### For Development

A debug keystore is automatically generated by Android Studio for development builds.
