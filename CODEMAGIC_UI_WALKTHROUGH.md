# ðŸŽ¯ Codemagic UI Setup - Step by Step Walkthrough

## ðŸš€ Complete UI Setup Guide (No YAML Required)

### Step 1: Create Account and Connect GitHub (3 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://codemagic.io
2. **Click "Get started for free"**
3. **Click "Continue with GitHub"**
4. **Authorize Codemagic** to access your repositories
5. **Complete your profile** (name, email)

### Step 2: Add Your Repository (2 minutes)

1. **On Codemagic dashboard**, click **"Add application"**
2. **Select "GitHub"** as the source
3. **Find your repository**: Look for `expense-tracker-android` (or whatever you named it)
4. **Click "Select"** next to your repository
5. **Choose "Android"** as the project type

### Step 3: Configure Workflow (5 minutes)

#### 3.1 Basic Settings
1. **Workflow name**: Keep default or change to "Android Release Build"
2. **Build triggers**: 
   - **Uncheck "Automatic build triggering"** (we'll build manually)
   - **Keep "Manual build triggering" checked**

#### 3.2 Environment Configuration
1. **Click "Environment" tab**
2. **Machine type**: Keep default (Linux VM)
3. **Java version**: Select **"17"** (important!)
4. **Android SDK**: Keep default
5. **Node.js**: Not needed, keep default

#### 3.3 Build Configuration
1. **Click "Build" tab**
2. **Pre-build script**: Leave empty
3. **Build script**: Replace everything with this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
set -x

echo "=== Creating Release Keystore ==="
mkdir -p keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore keystore/release.keystore \
  -alias expense_tracker_key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -dname "CN=ExpenseTracker, OU=Development, O=ExpenseTracker, L=City, S=State, C=US" \
  -storepass codemagic_build -keypass codemagic_build

echo "=== Configuring Gradle Signing ==="
echo "RELEASE_STORE_FILE=keystore/release.keystore" >> gradle.properties
echo "RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=codemagic_build" >> gradle.properties
echo "RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=expense_tracker_key" >> gradle.properties
echo "RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=codemagic_build" >> gradle.properties

echo "=== Making Gradlew Executable ==="
chmod +x gradlew

echo "=== Building Release APK ==="
./gradlew assembleRelease --stacktrace --info

echo "=== Build Complete ==="
ls -la app/build/outputs/apk/release/
```

4. **Post-build script**: Leave empty

#### 3.4 Publishing Configuration
1. **Click "Publish" tab**
2. **Artifacts**: 
   - **Check "Android artifacts"**
   - **Pattern**: `app/build/outputs/**/*.apk`
3. **Email notifications**:
   - **Add your email address**
   - **Check "Successful builds"**
   - **Check "Failed builds"**

### Step 4: Save and Start Build (1 minute)

1. **Click "Save"** at the top right
2. **Click "Start new build"**
3. **Select branch**: Choose "main" or "master" (whichever you used)
4. **Click "Start build"**

### Step 5: Monitor Build Progress (10-15 minutes)

#### Build Stages You'll See:
1. âœ… **Provisioning** (1-2 minutes) - Setting up build environment
2. âœ… **Cloning repository** (30 seconds) - Downloading your code
3. âœ… **Installing dependencies** (2-3 minutes) - Android SDK, Gradle
4. âœ… **Pre-build script** (skipped - we left it empty)
5. âœ… **Build script** (8-12 minutes) - Creating keystore and building APK
6. âœ… **Post-build script** (skipped - we left it empty)
7. âœ… **Publishing artifacts** (1 minute) - Uploading APK for download

#### Success Indicators:
- âœ… All stages show **green checkmarks**
- âœ… **"Build successful"** message appears
- âœ… **APK artifact** appears in artifacts section

### Step 6: Download Your APK (2 minutes)

1. **Scroll down** to "Artifacts" section
2. **Click "Download"** next to the APK file
3. **APK file** will be named something like: `app-release.apk`
4. **Save to your computer**

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Build Output

### Console Messages You Should See:
```
=== Creating Release Keystore ===
Generating 2,048 bit RSA key pair and self-signed certificate
[Storing keystore/release.keystore]

=== Configuring Gradle Signing ===
[Adding signing configuration]

=== Making Gradlew Executable ===
[Setting permissions]

=== Building Release APK ===
> Task :app:assembleRelease
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 8m 32s

=== Build Complete ===
-rw-r--r-- 1 builder builder 25M app-release.apk
```

### Build Time Breakdown:
- **Environment setup**: 3-4 minutes
- **Dependency download**: 2-3 minutes
- **APK compilation**: 6-8 minutes
- **Artifact upload**: 1 minute
- **Total**: 12-16 minutes

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails at "Creating Keystore"?
- **Check Java version** is set to 17
- **Verify keytool** is available (should be automatic)

### Build Fails at "Building APK"?
- **Check gradlew permissions** (our script handles this)
- **Verify all project files** are in repository
- **Check build logs** for specific Gradle errors

### No APK in Artifacts?
- **Check build completed successfully** (green checkmarks)
- **Verify artifact pattern**: `app/build/outputs/**/*.apk`
- **Look in build logs** for APK location

### Can't Download APK?
- **Try different browser** or incognito mode
- **Check file size** (should be ~25MB)
- **Wait a few minutes** and try again

## âœ… Success Checklist

- [ ] Codemagic account created and GitHub connected
- [ ] Repository added with Android project type
- [ ] Workflow configured with UI (not YAML)
- [ ] Java 17 selected in environment
- [ ] Build script added with keystore creation
- [ ] Artifacts configured for APK files
- [ ] Build started and completed successfully
- [ ] APK downloaded from artifacts section

## ðŸ“± Next Steps After Download

1. **Transfer APK** to your Android 11 device
2. **Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"**
3. **Install APK** by tapping the file
4. **Grant SMS permission** for automatic transaction detection
5. **Start using** your expense tracker!

**This UI approach should work much better than YAML configuration. The build process is straightforward and Codemagic handles most Android-specific setup automatically.**
